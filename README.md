# Tic-Tac-Toe in Python

This is a simple two-player Tic-Tac-Toe game that runs in the terminal. It was built using Python and focuses on clean object-oriented design. Players can choose their own names and symbols before starting the game.

## Features

- Two-player gameplay
- Players can enter their names and choose custom symbols (like X or O — or even their initials!)
- Input validation to prevent crashes or invalid moves
- Detects win conditions and draws
- Clean board display with auto screen-clearing between turns
- Option to restart the game after each match

## Why I Made This

I built this project to practice Python and get more comfortable with concepts like classes, loops, and user input handling.  
More importantly, I wanted to apply and reinforce the core principles of Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) that I’ve been learning — like encapsulation, modular design, and clean separation of concerns using classes.
